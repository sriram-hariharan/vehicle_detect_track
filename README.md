# vehicle_detect_track
Vehicle Detection and Tracking using Faster R-CNN and Yolo Model along with Deep SORT Algorithm. Uses the KITTI dataset


The Project in an in-progress project. Object detection has been implemented using Yolov4 and Faster R-CNN models. The vehicle detection using Deep SORT algorithm is in progress.

The code is in developement stage, hence will seem clutered. I aim to clean the code and include comments and descriptions appropriately.

Thanks for checking out my project!
